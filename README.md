# Among Us Crewmates Over Koco
GitHub repo for the Among Us Crewmates Over Koco mod for Sonic Frontiers.

This mod replaces the base Koco models with the red crewmate from Among Us. For now, it's only these specific Kocos. If there's really demand, I'd like to update in the future to add different color crewmates for the Koco variants, Among us SFX, and more. I'd love some ideas for the Elder and Hermit Koco's as well.<br><br>Created purely to fulfill the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/requests/42949">absolutely atrocious request</a>, but it had to be done.<br><br>Model credit goes entirely to <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crewmate-among-us-83abf847602f495eb37c304c4b21c9d5" target="_blank">ThatAverageJoe on Sketchfab.</a><br>
